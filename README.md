Folders:
- Unity: contains the Unity project, which has been modified to slightly adjust the observation space, the reward function and other minor details (e.g., the delta movement)
- Testing: contains the files to test the trained model in a builded environment (env_fullbody) or in the editor. To test the model in the builded env just run "main.py", for the editor option, see line 64 of the main file.
